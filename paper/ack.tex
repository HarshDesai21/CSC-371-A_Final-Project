\subsection{AI Acknowledgment}

%update ack

Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) was used for debugging, organizing code, and at times graphing data. Portions of code generated or assisted by ChatGPT are documented, and the prompt for this assignment was not fed into any form of LLM to generate our project. The written work in this paper is our own and had no AI involvement. 

% This section is optional. But if there are people you'd like to thank for their help with the project --- a person who contributed some insight, friends who volunteered to help out with data collection, etc. --- then this is the place to thank them. Keep it short!
